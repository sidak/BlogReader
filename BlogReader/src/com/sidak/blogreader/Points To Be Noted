i have a textview in layout , so that when there is no data , still shows something ,
otherwise the user will think that data is loading

STATIC IMPLIES THAT WE CAN ACCESS THE NUMBER OF POSTS WITHOUT CREATING AN INSTANCE OF THE CLASS

exception variable is limited to the scope of the catch block

we do nesting of classes , when we want to use that class within our 
primary class and not use anywhere else

... means we can pass in 0 or more parameters
we initialise the response code if anything goes wrong in the try block

if network is not there , then networkInfo object will be null

if there is an 'if' condition, that check two things using an &&
operator , both of them should return booleans and
thus u can't write:
if(abc && ghi==9)

if the HttpUrlConnection object is able to connect to the server , 
then the server sends the response code of 200, which means OK

we need to force close the app, so that oncreate cld be called again

the data transferred in case of json is minimal as compared to xml or other methods
