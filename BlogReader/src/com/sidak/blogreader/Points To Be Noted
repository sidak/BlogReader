i have a textview in layout , so that when there is no data , still shows something ,
otherwise the user will think that data is loading

STATIC IMPLIES THAT WE CAN ACCESS THE NUMBER OF POSTS WITHOUT CREATING AN INSTANCE OF THE CLASS

exception variable is limited to the scope of the catch block

we do nesting of classes , when we want to use that class within our 
primary class and not use anywhere else

... means we can pass in 0 or more parameters
we initialise the response code if anything goes wrong in the try block

if network is not there , then networkInfo object will be null

if there is an 'if' condition, that check two things using an &&
operator , both of them should return booleans and
thus u can't write:
if(abc && ghi==9)

if the HttpUrlConnection object is able to connect to the server , 
then the server sends the response code of 200, which means OK

we need to force close the app, so that oncreate cld be called again

the data transferred in case of json is minimal as compared to xml or other methods

the json array is a little different from the normal array and we can't access the elements by using [i]

read() returns an int, we cast it to char later,
read() without parameters returns one character,
A return value of -1 means that we reached the end

if logcat stops showing messages
try and see what is checked in ddms view

also:
Try this: 

On Linux or Mac OS X:

./adb kill-server
./adb start-server


onPostExecute works on our UI thread and can update the layout with our results

since the asynctask class is an inner class , we can reference the member var's of MainListActivity

Try to keep nested classes together at the bottom

Everytime u r working with json data , u need to hv try catch blocks

fromHtml returns a type c/d spannable basically strings with html like content
